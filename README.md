# Computer Skills

I possess a diverse set of computer skills that enable me to tackle a wide range of projects and challenges. 

## Programming Languages
I am proficient in several programming languages, including C++, C, Python, Java, Lua, and MatLab. These languages allow me to approach problems from different angles and choose the most suitable one for a given task. Python, with its simplicity and extensive libraries, is my go-to language for various applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning. Meanwhile, C++, C, and Java provide me with the power and efficiency needed for system-level programming and application development, while Lua and MatLab help me excel in specialized domains.

## Libraries and Frameworks
In the domain of libraries and frameworks, I have expertise in several essential tools:
- Qt: I am skilled in using Qt, a powerful framework and library widely used for building cross-platform graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Qt has been instrumental in creating intuitive robot control interfaces.
- TensorFlow, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, OpenCV, Keras, and PyTorch: These libraries are crucial for data science and machine learning. They enable me to work with complex datasets, develop predictive models, and implement cutting-edge deep learning algorithms. They empower me to extract meaningful insights from data and create intelligent applications that can make a difference.

## Robotics and Simulation
In the realm of robotics and simulation, I have acquired significant skills and expertise across various platforms. I am well-versed in ROS (Robot Operating System), where I have developed ROS-based applications, created custom robot behaviors, and integrated diverse sensors and actuators. I have practical experience with the Webots Simulator, utilizing it for modeling and testing robot behaviors in diverse environments. Additionally, I possess strong skills in PyBullet, Gazebo, and MuJoCo, which include developing and fine-tuning physics-based simulations, designing, testing, and evaluating robot models and control algorithms, and modeling and simulating complex robotic movements and interactions. These skills collectively equip me to contribute effectively to projects in the dynamic fields of robotics and simulation.


## Document Typesetting
I am skilled in document typesetting using LaTeX. Whether it's creating research papers, technical documents, or reports, LaTeX helps me maintain a professional and polished appearance for my written work. It's a valuable tool in academia and industry, and my proficiency ensures that my documents are not only well-structured but also visually appealing.

These computer skills form the foundation of my technical expertise and enable me to approach a wide range of projects with confidence and creativity. Whether I'm coding, analyzing data, working with robots, or creating documents, my skills allow me to make a meaningful impact in various fields of computer science and engineering.
